Cabin Porn It
==========

Set the current screen to a cabin from CabinPorn.com.

Default is set to the most recent picture, which it downloads and puts into a
folder in the current directory.

PRs accepted but not expected.

### Installation

Download cabin-porn-it.py to wherever you want, or clone this entire repository.

Run using `python cabin-porn-it.py` or see below for creating a `cabin` global alias.

If you get an error about `bs4` missing:

```
ImportError: No module named bs4
```

Then you will need to install dependencies. If you do not already have the `pip` command, run:

```
sudo easy_install pip
```

Once `pip` is available, dependencies can be installed with:

```
sudo pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

####Using Large Images
If you plan to use the large image flag, you will need to install `pillow`. Normally this can be done with:

```
sudo pip install pillow
```

If that does not work, try installing the [source file](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.8.1) and running `python setup.py install`.

_Requirements_: Python 2.7+, Mac OSX Mavericks

###Automate

Alternatively, if you want to set it up to be automatic:

```
chmod a+x cabin-porn-it.py
ln -s $(pwd)/cabin-porn-it.py /usr/local/bin/cabin
```

This will allow you to type `$ cabin` whenever you, you know, want a new cabin. Note: If you set this up, the base dir will be relative to your home folder. Adding in an absolute path as the base directory will stop this from putting pictures into your base Pictures/ folder. For instance: `$ cabin path=/Users/richard/Pictures/cabins`. 

####Launchctl

If you want this to run automatically, put the `com.burntfen.cabin-porn-it.plist` file in your Library/LaunchAgents/ folder. plist files are the preferred way in Mac OSX of running cronjobs - using the native launchctrl program. Edit the file by adding a `<script>-r</script>` line if you want a random photo, and change the integer number to whatever amount of seconds you want (3600 is one hour). Then, run: 
`launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgent/com.burntfen.cabin-porn-it.plist`. For troubleshooting and more configuration options, see this [excellent explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15820488/1166929) of launchctl. 

If you do this, the base directory needs to be an absolute path (see above), or permissions will most likely break and the script won't work. 

####Crontab
If you want to use the old crontab, type: `env EDITOR=nano crontab -e`. From there, enter in `* */3 * * * /path/to/cabin-porn-it.py`. Save and you should be good: it'll check every two hours if there is a new picture for you or not. If you want a random picture, just add an ` -r` at the end, of course.

###Options

* `-r`, choose a random image from the current page
* `-l`, limit images to images larger than 1024x748
* `path=BASE_DIR`, choose a directory for the photos to be put into
